        What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one. It's a list of tasks you need to complete or things that
        you want to do. Most typically, they're organised in order of priority. Traditionally, they're written on a
        piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid. Don't have a piece of paper? Don't worry.
        <Link href="/todo" className="text-primary whitespace-nowrap">

          I've got something for you! <span className="text-2xl">Â»</span>
